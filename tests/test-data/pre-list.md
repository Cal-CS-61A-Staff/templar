* Use `print` statements at the end of a `while` loop to view the
  state of the counter variables after each iteration:

        i = 0
        while i < n:
            i += func(i)
            print('i is', i)

* Don't just put random `print` statements after lines that are
  obviously correct.

    This is a normal pre
